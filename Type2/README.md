## Tasks

### Problem 1
Generate Music using a open-source AI music generator by META, [MusicGen](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/12/meta-open-sources-an-ai-powered-music-generator/) or by using [songr.ai](https://www.songr.ai/) and share them in the `AI_Music_Submissions` folder.
Within your Pull Request, mention the prompt and configurations used to generate the Music. As such a music representation is subjective,
we'll have judges who will pick the best best and they will be accepted.

Submit your `song` and `prompt` in a folder named as `yourname_AI_Music_Song` and `yourname_AI_Music_Prompt` within `AI_Music_Submissions` folder.
